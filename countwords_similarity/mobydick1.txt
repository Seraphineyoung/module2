loomings

call me ishmael some years ago never mind how long
precisely having little or no money in my purse and nothing
particular to interest me on shore i thought i would sail about a
little and see the watery part of the world it is a way i have of
driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation whenever i
find myself growing grim about the mouth whenever it is a damp
drizzly november in my soul whenever i find myself involuntarily
pausing before coffin warehouses used in ladies bodices but
this same bone is not in the tail it is in the head which is a sad
mistake for a sagacious lawyer like prynne but is the queen a
mermaid to be presented with a tail an allegorical meaning may
lurk here

there are two royal fish so styled by the english law writers the
whale and the sturgeon both royal property under certain
limitations and nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown s
ordinary revenue i know not that any other author has hinted of the
matter but by inference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be
divided in the same way as the whale the king receiving the highly
dense and elastic head peculiar to that fish which symbolically
regarded may possibly be humorously grounded upon some presumed
congeniality and thus there seems a reason in all things even in
law

chapter 91

the pequod meets the rose bud

in vain it was to rake for ambergriese in the paunch of this
leviathan insufferable fetor denying not inquiry
sir t browne v e

it was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted and when
we were slowly sailing over a sleepy vapoury mid day sea that the
many noses on the pequod s deck proved more vigilant discoverers than
the three pairs of eyes aloft a peculiar and not very pleasant
smell was smelt in the sea

i will bet something now said stubb that somewhere hereabouts
are some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day i thought
they would keel up before long

presently the vapours in advance slid aside and there in the
distance lay a ship whose furled sails betokened that some sort of
whale must be alongside as we glided nearer the stranger showed
french colours from his peak and by the eddying cloud of vulture
sea fowl that circled and hovered and swooped around him it was
plain that the whale alongside must be what the fishermen call a
blasted whale that is a whale that has died unmolested on the sea
and so floated an unappropriated corpse it may well be conceived
what an unsavory odor such a mass must exhale worse than an assyrian
city in the plague when the living are incompetent to bury the
departed so intolerable indeed is it regarded by some that no
cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it yet are there
those who will still do it notwithstanding the fact that the oil
obtained from such subjects is of a very inferior quality and by no
means of the nature of attar of rose

coming still nearer with the expiring breeze we saw that the
frenchman had a second whale alongside and this second whale seemed
even more of a nosegay than the first in truth it turned out to be
one of those problematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a
sort of prodigious dyspepsia or indigestion leaving their defunct
bodies almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil nevertheless
in the proper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever
turn up his nose at such a whale as this however much he may shun
blasted whales in general

the pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger that stubb vowed he
recognised his cutting spade pole entangled in the lines that were
knotted round the tail of one of these whales

there s a pretty fellow now he banteringly laughed standing in
the ship s bows there s a jackal for ye i well know that these
crappoes of frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery sometimes
lowering their boats for breakers mistaking them for sperm whale
spouts yes and sometimes sailing from their port with their hold
full of boxes of tallow candles and cases of snuffers foreseeing
that all the oil they will get won t be enough to dip the captain s
wick into aye we all know these things but look ye here s a
crappo that is content with our leavings the drugged whale there i
mean aye and is content too with scraping the dry bones of that
other precious fish he has there poor devil i say pass round a
hat some one and let s make him a present of a little oil for dear
charity s sake for what oil he ll get from that drugged whale
there wouldn t be fit to burn in a jail no not in a condemned
cell and as for the other whale why i ll agree to get more oil by
chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours than he ll get
from that bundle of bones though now that i think of it it may
contain something worth a good deal more than oil yes ambergris i
wonder now if our old man has thought of that it s worth trying
yes i m for it and so saying he started for the quarter deck

by this time the faint air had become a complete calm so that
whether or no the pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell with
no hope of escaping except by
