## debugging using breakpoints 
#1) double click next to the line number of your code to set up a breakpoint,a red circle should
#appear 
#2)you can now run your code in debug mode using debugging buttons on the toolbar
#  - first button is for you to start running your code until the break point.
#  - second button allows you to run your code line-by-line until the breakpoint.
#  - third one is for stepping into the sections (class and functions) 
#  - fourth button is for you to step out when you feel that the error is not related to the current section
#  - fith button is for you to go to the next breakpoint
#  - last, square shaped button is for you to exit debugging mode and go back to normal coding mode.
